<think> Alright , I need to help the user by generating a Java API client based on the provided Swagger YAML specification . First , I 'll look at the YAML structure to understand the endpoints and their requirements . The Swagger YAML has two API groups : Users and Products . Each group has multiple endpoints with different request and response formats . My goal is to create an API client that can handle these requests and responses in Java . I 'll start by considering how to model the data structures . Enums like User Status and UserRole make sense for categor izing statuses and roles . The models , such as CreateUser DTO and Get User Details Model , should represent the incoming request objects . Similarly , response classes like GetUser Response will handle the returned JSON data . Next , I need to decide on the HTTP verbs supported by each endpoint . For example , POST is used for creating a user , while GET is appropriate for retrieving details . I 'll map each Swagger operation to the corresponding Java method in the client class . For authentication , I 'll include basic authentication using a Username Password Auth enticator . This means I need to implement the Authentication interface and provide username and password credentials when making requests . I should structure the API client as an abstract class with methods for different HTTP verbs ( GET , POST , PUT , DELETE ) returning ResponseEntity objects . Each method will handle parsing the response based on the expected format and data type . In the implementation , I 'll use J AX -R S annotations to define the REST ful endpoints . The client class will have protected fields for the request and response formats , allowing it to switch between different formats as needed . I also need to consider error handling . After each HTTP request , I 'll check if the response is successful . If not , I 'll handle exceptions by logging them or throwing runtime exceptions based on the error status code . Security aspects are important too . I 'll include methods for authentic ating requests and setting cookies , ensuring that only authorized users can access certain endpoints . Finally , I 'll provide examples of how to use the API client with each endpoint , demonstrating how to create objects , authenticate , make requests , and handle responses or exceptions . Throughout this process , I should ensure that the code is clean , well -d ocumented , and follows best practices for Java EE applications . Testing each endpoint 's implementation would be crucial , but since this is a code example , thorough testing beyond the provided code is assumed . </think> Here 's an implementation of an API client in Java that matches the Swagger specification : ``` java package com .example .swagger .api .client ; import com .example .swagger .models .*; import com .example .swagger .service .*; import javax 反转 ; // For request and response handling import java .io .IOException ; import java .util .Map ; public class Swagger ApiClient { private final String REST _URL ; private final Swagger Request Format request Format ; private final Swagger Response Format response Format ; private Username Password Auth enticator authentic ator = new Username Password Auth enticator (); public Swagger ApiClient (String url , Swagger Request Format request Format , Swagger Response Format response Format ) { this . REST _URL = url ; this .request Format = request Format ; this .response Format = response Format ; } @ J AX -R S public abstract class List Or Get Action <T > throws IOException { @ GetMapping ( new J AX -R S )" @ ApiOperation (value Format =get Operation Format (get Map Method Of Operation .IDENTITY + " responses "), operation Format = get Operation Format (Map Method .IDENTITY + " response ") )" ) public ResponseEntity <?> get Map Method Of Operation .IDENTITY Response (); // Similar methods for other HTTP verbs ( put , delete ) and endpoints would follow here } @ J AX -R S public abstract class CreateUser Action { @ PostMapping ( new J AX -R S )" @ ApiOperation (value Format =get Operation Format (Map Method .CREATE + " response "), operation Format = get Operation Format (Map Method .CREATE + " response ") )" ) public ResponseEntity <?> createUser (D OM AIN Model Create User create User DTO ) throws IOException ; // Authentication methods would follow here } @ J AX -R S public abstract class GetUser Action { @ GetMapping ( new J AX -R S )" @ ApiOperation (value Format =get Operation Format (Map Method .GET + " response "), operation Format = get Operation Format (Map Method .GET + " response ") ) ", query Parameters = [" _ id "] ) public ResponseEntity <?> getUser (D omain Model Get User user ) throws IOException ; @ GetMapping ( new J AX -R S )" @ ApiOperation (value Format =get Operation Format (Map Method .GET + " responses "), operation Format = get Operation Format (Map Method .GET + " responses ") ) ", query Parameters = [" page ", " perPage "] ) public ResponseEntity <?> getUsers (P aging Get Users paging ) throws IOException ; // Authentication methods would follow here } // Example implementation for CreateUser Action class @ Override @ J AX -R S public ResponseEntity <?> createUser (D OM AIN Model Create User create User DTO ) throws IOException { try { // Encode the request body to JSON String requestBody = create User DTO .toJson (); String headers = " Content -Type : application /json "; String full Url = REST _URL + "/ api /users /create "; // Make the HTTP request with authentication Response response = session 做出 的 请求 ( new POST ( REST _URL + "/ api /users /create ", requestBody , headers ), authentic ator ); if ( response .isSuccessful ()) { // Parse the response into a User model return new GetUser Response (response .json Value (), create User DTO .userId ); } else { throw new IOException (" Failed to create user : " + response .message ()); } } catch ( Exception e ) { throw new IOException (" Error creating user : " + e .getMessage (), e ); } } // Example implementation for GetUser Action class @ Override @ J AX -R S public ResponseEntity <?> getUser (D omain Model Get User user ) throws IOException { String full Url = REST _URL + "/ api /users /" + user .getId (); try { Response response = session 做出 的 请求 ( new GET (full Url ), authentic ator ); if ( response .isSuccessful ()) { // Parse the response into a User model return new GetUser Response (response .json Value (), null ); } else { throw new IOException (" Failed to retrieve user : " + response .message ()); } } catch ( Exception e ) { throw new IOException (" Error retrieving user : " + e .getMessage (), e ); } } // Abstract methods for handling different HTTP verbs and endpoints would follow here } `` ` This implementation provides a basic structure for an API client that can handle the specified Swagger operations . Here 's what each part does : 1 . README.md bin mvnw mvnw.cmd pom.xml prompt src target testbench.iml Enums **: Defines data types such as ` User Status ` and ` UserRole ` to categor ize user statuses . 2 . README.md bin mvnw mvnw.cmd pom.xml prompt src target testbench.iml Model Classes **: Represents incoming request objects like ` Create User DTO ` and response models like ` Get User Details Model `. 3 . README.md bin mvnw mvnw.cmd pom.xml prompt src target testbench.iml Response Classes **: Defines how responses should be handled , e .g ., ` Get User Response `. 4 . README.md bin mvnw mvnw.cmd pom.xml prompt src target testbench.iml HTTP Methods **: Implements common HTTP verbs ( POST , GET , etc .) for different endpoints . 5 . README.md bin mvnw mvnw.cmd pom.xml prompt src target testbench.iml Authentication **: Uses basic authentication with username /password credentials through the ` Username Password Auth enticator `. 6 . README.md bin mvnw mvnw.cmd pom.xml prompt src target testbench.iml Request / Response Handling **: Converts between Java objects and JSON representations as per Swagger specification . To use this API client , you would : 1 . Define your request /response formats using annotations . 2 . Create classes for each HTTP verb ( e .g ., ` Create User Action `, ` Get Users Action ` ). 3 . Implement the business logic in these classes . 4 . Use the client class to make requests and handle responses . For example , here 's how you might use the client : ``` java public static void main (String [] args ) { Swagger ApiClient api = new Swagger ApiClient ( " http :// localhost : 8 0 8 0 /api ", Swagger Request Format .J ava Object , Swagger Response Format .J ava Object ); // Creating a user Domain Model Create User createUser DTO = ... ; ResponseEntity <?> response = api .createUser (create User DTO ); if ( response .getStatusCode () != HttpStatus .SC _OK ) { throw new IOException (" Failed to create user : " + response .getBody ()); } Swagger Response response Data = Swagger Response .parse (response ); // Process the response data ... // Getting a user Domain Model Get User user = ... ; ResponseEntity <?> user Response = api .getUser (user ); if ( user Response .getStatusCode () != HttpStatus .SC _OK ) { throw new IOException (" Failed to retrieve user : " + user Response .getBody ()); } Swagger Response response Data = Swagger Response .parse (user Response ); // Process the response data ... } `` ` This is a basic implementation and can be extended to handle more complex scenarios , including : - Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes . - More sophisticated authentication mechanisms . - Rate limiting and pacing . - C aching of frequently accessed resources . - Logging requests and responses . Remember to implement all the missing HTTP methods ( PUT , DELETE , etc .) in the abstract classes provided by the API client .
