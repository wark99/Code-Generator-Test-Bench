## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**language** | **String** | By default, the Connect application is in English. You don&#39;t need to pass this parameter unless you want to translate Connect into one of our supported languages.  * Spanish (United States): &#x60;es&#x60; * French (Canada): &#x60;fr&#x60;  |  [optional] |
|**partnerId** | **String** | Your Partner ID displayed in the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.mastercard.com/account/log-in) |  |
|**customerId** | **String** | A customer ID. See Add Customer API for how to create a customer ID. |  |
|**institutionLoginId** | **String** | An institution login ID (from the account record) |  |
|**redirectUri** | **String** | The URL that customers will be redirected to after completing Finicity Connect. Required unless Connect is embedded inside our application (iframe). |  [optional] |
|**webhook** | **String** | The publicly available URL you want to be notified with events as the user progresses through the application. See [Connect Webhook Event](https://developer.mastercard.com/open-banking-us/documentation/webhooks/webhooks-connect/) for event details. |  [optional] |
|**webhookContentType** | **String** | The content type the webhook events will be sent in. Supported types: \&quot;application/json\&quot; and \&quot;application/xml\&quot;. |  [optional] |
|**webhookData** | **Object** | Allows additional identifiable information to be inserted into the payload of connect webhook events. See: [Custom Webhooks](https://developer.mastercard.com/open-banking-us/documentation/webhooks/webhooks-custom/). |  [optional] |
|**webhookHeaders** | **Object** | Allows additional identifiable information to be included as headers of connect webhook event. See: [Custom Webhooks](https://developer.mastercard.com/open-banking-us/documentation/webhooks/webhooks-custom/). |  [optional] |
|**experience** | **String** | The &#x60;experience&#x60; field allows you to customize: * Brand: color and logo * Icon: displayed on the \&quot;Share your data\&quot; page * Popular institutions: displayed on the Bank Search page * Report: the credit decisioning report to send when Connect completes. * MVS modules: financial, payroll, paystub  Note: the Finicity sales engineers (SE) help you set up a default experience for your company. For each additional experience you create thereafter, they&#39;ll give you a unique ID. See [Configure the Connect Experience](https://developer.mastercard.com/open-banking-us/documentation/connect/configure-connect-experience/).  Experience values options: * \&quot;default\&quot;: your default experience (must be defined) * GUID: the code for a different experience * Not defined: If you don&#39;t pass the experience parameter, then Connect&#39;s out of the box default experience (add accounts but no branding) is used, and the MVS modules will not run. |  [optional] |
|**singleUseUrl** | **Boolean** | \&quot;true\&quot;: The URL link expires after a Connect session successfully completes.  Note: when the &#x60;singleUseUrl&#x60; and the &#x60;experience&#x60; parameters are passed in the same call, the &#x60;singleUseUrl&#x60; value overrides the &#x60;singleUseUrl&#x60; value configured in the &#x60;experience&#x60; parameter. |  [optional] |
|**isWebView** | **Boolean** | \&quot;true\&quot;: Indicates that the Connect Session will be displayed within a WebView. When the &#x60;isWebView&#x60; parameter is &#x60;true&#x60; the &#x60;redirectUri&#x60; parameter is required.  Note: This parameter is no longer recommended. We instead recommend specifying a &#x60;redirectUrl&#x60; through our WebSDK.
